# Sudoku-Solver (unfinished)

This is just a simple side-project which combines my recreational hobby of sudoku with my programming. This is an attempt to make an algorithm by myself, pooling little to no outside help and mapping the logic individually.

Once the project is complete and in a working state (as noted by the title of this readme), a full layout of the algorithm's inner workings will be shown below.
